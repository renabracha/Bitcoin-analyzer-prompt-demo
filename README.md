# Bitcoin Analyzer

## Acknowledgment
This is my very first project through which I have taken the initial step toward transitioning from classical machine learning to large language models. I would like to thank the following individuals and organisations that made this project possible. 
* Rahul Bhandari for giving me the a-ha! moment with his Bitcoin-analyzer-with-prompts project (`https://github.com/rahul-0000-code/`) by showing me how to turn my hazy feeling about the possibility of creating a Python program only with prompt engineering techniques into a practical viability. 
* Groq for providing me free access to their API key and thereby allowing me to gain hands-on experience in making API calls without having to constantly worry about token limits.

## Abstract
This project demonstrates that well-crafted prompting alone can be sufficient to build a web application that analyzes real-time Bitcoin price data and provides basic investment advice â€” all without the need for complex programming or agent frameworks.

## Development Notes
* **Streamlit** made web app development straightforward. With just a few lines of intuitive Python code, I was able to create a functional user interface.
* This was my first time pulling live data using an API key. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple the process turned out to be.

## Challenges
The most time-consuming part of this project was finding a free API key with suitable data access. Bitcoin price data is retrieved from [CoinPaprika](https://coinpaprika.com/) using their free API. Unfortunately, the free tier only provides two data points from the last 24 hours, which is quite limiting. Ideally, access to a 7-day price history would have allowed for more robust analysis.

That said, the project still achieved its goal: to prove that prompt engineering can deliver meaningful insight from even minimal data. As a proof of concept, it successfully shows how far you can go with lightweight tools and careful design.

## Installation
To run bitcoin_analyzer.py, do the following:

### Step 1. Place the files in a folder. 
1. Place the `.py` file in a local folder (e.g. `C:\temp\bitcoin_analyzer`).
2. Create a file called `.env` and place the GROQ API key in the following format:
	`GROQ_API_KEY = <groq_api_key>`
3. Place the `.env` file in the same local folder. 

### Step 2. Install Python. 
1. In Windows, open the Command Prompt window.
2. Make sure Python is installed. In the Command Prompt window, type:
	`python --version`
If you get an error or "Python is not recognized", you need to install Python:
	1. Go to `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.
	2. Download the latest Python installer for Windows
	3. Run the installer and make sure to check `Add Python to PATH` during installation

### Step 3. Set up a virtual environment. 
This keeps your project dependencies isolated:
1. In the Command Prompt window, go to the script folder. Type:<br>
	`cd C:\<path to your script folder>`
2. In the Command Prompt, create a Python virtual environment named `bitcoin_env`.<br>
	`python -m venv bitcoin_env`
3. In the Command Prompt, activate the Python virtual environment.<br>
	`bitcoin_env\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required dependencies.<br>
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 4. Run the script. 
1. In the Command Prompt window, run the Streamlit application. Type:<br>
	`streamlit run bitcoin_analyzer.py`
<br>
<br>
This will start a local web server and open the application in your browser. Press the Analyse button to view the results.
